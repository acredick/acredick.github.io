      "Volunteered on a project promoting accessible green infrastructure practices (rain barrels and cisterns) to the public. Developed a cost evaluation tool to assess the life cycle costs of the average rain barrel in the Brentwood watershed of Austin, Texas. Optimized the MATLAB software package AMALGAM for rainwater harvesting optimization. Integrated AMALGAM with the cost evaluation tool and SWAT-CPDN, a soil and groundwater simulation tool, to derive Pareto-optimal solutions for cost-effective rainwater harvesting strategies.",
